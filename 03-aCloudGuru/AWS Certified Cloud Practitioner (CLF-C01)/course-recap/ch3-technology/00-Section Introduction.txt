This is the "Technology" section, where we'll be learning about the AWS services that you'll encounter on your Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

It will make up about 33% of the questions you'll encounter.
Now, jumping into AWS for the first time, there are over 200 of them.Throughout this course,we'll be focusing on only the services
that you may encounter on the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.
One of my favorite quotes from re:Invent 2021

about how customers ask for services,AWS builds them, and then customers complain about how many services are available.
it also shows us how we should think about services on AWS.
We need to think about not only what the service does, but what is the business use case that drove that service into existence.
So as you learn about these services, What does the service do and who is using the service?

let's talk about the different categories
of services that you may encounter.
First, we're going to talk about compute services:How you can provision compute from AWS.
Then there's storage and content delivery.
There's networking,which tends to focus on how to connect your local environment to AWS.
You'll learn about databases and the myriad ways you can provision databases on AWS.
You'll learn about migration and transfer:How to get your services from on-premise into the AWS cloud.
You'll also learn some analytics services: Services that help you make sense of your data.
You'll learn about machine learning and developer tools.
Finally, you'll learn about deployment and infrastructure management,

and then you'll learn about auditing,
