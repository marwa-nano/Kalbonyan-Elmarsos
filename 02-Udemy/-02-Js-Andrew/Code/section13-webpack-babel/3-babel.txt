the goal is to create JavaScript applications that actually work in all

browsers but still use cutting edge features to get that done.

We're going to be using a tool and that tool is called Babel. take our JavaScript code and convert it to something that all browsers understand.

So if we use a fancy cutting edge feature when we're writing our script, Babel is going to convert

that to a  feature that all browsers understand, and that's what's actually going to run behind

the scenes.

This still allows us to work with and write code using the cutting edge features, but our application

will work pretty much everywhere.

https://babeljs.io/   -->Babel is a JavaScript compiler.
Babble takes code.We write with the latest features and it compiles it down into more simple code that older browsers
can understand.

to be able to perform this conversion process with files locally on our machine, we're going to have to

install Babul as a command line tool.So we install it like we installed live server earlier in the course.
-g falg to install globally
we used NPM install -g babel-cli
cli --> CLI, which stands for the Babul command line interface.
run test command babel --version -->print the version of Babille currently installed.
