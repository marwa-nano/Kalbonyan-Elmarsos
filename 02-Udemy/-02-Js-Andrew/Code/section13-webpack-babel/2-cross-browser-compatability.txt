
much older browsers that don't support the newer features or taking advantage of in this modern JavaScript

boot camp.

They're probably just going to think the application is broken.

They're probably not going to assume that it has something to do with the browser they're using.

So this browser incompatibility for a feature is going to be a big problem for us.

If we want to write modern JavaScript code and have our applications work everywhere, we are going

to need to introduce a bit of tooling.

The tooling that we're going to introduce is going to solve those two key problems.

The first problem, older browsers are never going to update to support these newer features.

So if we want to use them, which we do, we have to figure out a way to work around that which we're

going to.

The second problem is that there are newer JavaScript features out there that currently aren't supported

by any browser, even the latest and greatest.

So the tooling that we're going to set up is going to solve that problem to allowing us to use the most

advanced cutting edge features in the language.
