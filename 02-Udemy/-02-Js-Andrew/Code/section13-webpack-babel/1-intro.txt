we focusing on two tools.

The first is Babel and the second is Web pack.

The first tool babel that's going to make sure that our application runs in a wider range of browsers

as possible, even really old browsers that are no longer being updated to support the latest new JavaScript

features.

The second tool we're going to use Web pack is also going to give us access to a lot of new stuff.

The most exciting thing is the JavaScript module system that gives us a whole new way to structure and

architect our apps.
