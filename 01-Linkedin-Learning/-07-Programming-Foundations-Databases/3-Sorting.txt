sorting by order by clause

here we sorted by name  
SELECT * FROM Dishes ORDER BY `Name';
  
by default with Ascending order,It's represented by ASC 
SELECT * FROM Dishes ORDER BY `Name` ASC;

and Ican invert the sort to descending by changing that to DESC.
SELECT * FROM Dishes ORDER BY `Name` DESC;

sorting work with any data types hass logical order
SELECT * FROM Dishes ORDER BY Price;
SELECT * FROM Reservations ORDER BY 'Date';

SELECT * FROM Reservations
WHERE 'Date' > "2019-02-06" AND `Date` < "2019-02-07"
ORDER BY 'Date';
